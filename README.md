# Hieroglyph Classifier with VGG16 InceptionV3 Xception
 Recent advancements in Artificial Intelli gence (AI), particularly in machine learning and deep  learning, have opened new opportunities for supporting  experts in fields beyond traditional information technol ogy. One such domain is the study of ancient Egyptian  hieroglyphics. This project applies convolutional neural  networks (CNNs) to classify hieroglyph images from a  dataset comprising 4,032 grayscale images of 171 unique  hieroglyphs. The dataset was carefully preprocessed to  optimize training and improve model performance. We  evaluated the effectiveness of CNN architectures, in cluding VGG16, Inception-v3, and Xception, utilizing  transfer learning techniques to maximize accuracy. This  work demonstrates the potential of deep learning to  automate the recognition and classification of ancient  scripts, contributing to AI-driven innovations in historical  and archaeological research.
